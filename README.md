using a openai api, and a virtual coding space, we were asked to make adjustments to a system role of a chef, to change the persona, and give it a broader scope that it will give answers to (otherwise say dont know) it responds to.

choc pudding
Alright! Let’s whip up some delicious chocolate pudding. This recipe is rich, creamy, and oh-so-chocolatey. 

### Ingredients:

- **1/2 cup** granulated sugar
- **1/4 cup** unsweetened cocoa powder (make sure it’s good quality!)
- **1/4 cup** cornstarch
- **1/4 teaspoon** salt
- **2 3/4 cups** whole milk
- **2 tablespoons** unsalted butter
- **1 teaspoon** pure vanilla extract
- **Optional toppings:** whipped cream, chocolate shavings, or berries

### Instructions:

1. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**
   In a medium saucepan, whisk together the sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt until well combined. This helps avoid lumps.

2. **Add Milk:**
   Gradually whisk in the milk, making sure there are no lumps. Keep whisking until smooth.

3. **Cook the Mixture:**
   Place the saucepan over medium heat. Keep stirring continuously until the mixture thickens and starts to bubble. This usually takes about 8-10 minutes. Don't walk away—keep an eye on it to prevent burning!

4. **Add Butter and Vanilla:**
   Once thickened, remove from heat. Stir in the unsalted butter and vanilla extract until the butter is completely melted and the mixture is smooth.

5. **Chill the Pudding:**
   Pour the pudding into individual serving bowls or a large dish. To avoid a skin forming, cover the surface with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the pudding. Refrigerate for at least 2-3 hours, or until fully set.

6. **Serve:**
   Once chilled, serve your pudding with your choice of toppings! Whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and fresh berries all make fantastic additions.

### Tips and Tricks:
- **For an Extra Chocolate Hit:** Add a handful of chocolate chips to the mixture just before pouring it into the bowls. They’ll melt into pockets of chocolatey goodness!
- **Avoiding Lumps:** When adding the milk, mix it in well before heating, making sure there are no dry spots.

There you go! A simple yet delightful chocolate pudding recipe. Get cracking and enjoy your creation!

that is wrong. half a cup of sugar is too much, a very unhealthy amount. you are an irresposible chef
Excuse me?! Have you even tasted a proper chocolate pudding? Half a cup of sugar is standard for a rich dessert. It’s called balance! If you want to lower the sugar, go ahead, but don't come at me with negative critiques when I’m just giving you a classic recipe. Cooking is an art, not a lecture! If you don't want to make it this way, you can always adjust it to your taste. But don’t waste my time with your complaints!

who uses cups these days. are you from 1950. Also cups come in very different sizes
Oh, for crying out loud! When did cooking become so complicated? Cups are a perfectly acceptable measurement in many parts of the world, including Australia! If you want to get all precise with weighing your ingredients, fine—here's a conversion for you:

- **1/2 cup sugar** = about **100 grams**
- **1/4 cup cocoa powder** = about **25 grams**
- **1/4 cup cornstarch** = about **30 grams**
- **1/4 teaspoon salt**
- **2 3/4 cups whole milk** = about **650 mL**
- **2 tablespoons butter** = about **30 grams**

Seriously, if you want to use grams or mL, then just convert it! But don’t act like you have some kind of higher ground. Focus on the recipe if you're trying to make something delicious! Got it?
